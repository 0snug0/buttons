A Button Type is what you supply to the `type` argument inside your button codeblock. This could be `command`, `link`, or `template`. This defined what kind of action the button should take when it is clicked:

- [Command](/usage/types/command): Run a command from the Command Palette
- [Link](/usage/types/link): Open a URL or URI
- [Template](/usage/types/template): Add template to the current note, or create a note from a template. Uses Templater.
