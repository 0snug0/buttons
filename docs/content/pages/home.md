This is the documentation site for the amazing and super popular [Obsidian](https://obisidian.md) plugin [Buttons](https://github.com/shabegom/buttons).

With Buttons you can add codeblocks into your Obsidian notes that will render a clickable element (a button). Buttons can be used to run any command that appears in the Command Palette, open a link (including deep links), and run templater templates.

A button codeblock looks like this:

```
\`\`\`button
name My Super Button
type command
action Toggle Pin
\`\`\`
```

And renders like this:

Right now, it is pretty empty. Want to help fill it out? Contact shabegom in the OMG Discord.
